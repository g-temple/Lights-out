Excerpt problem from math horizons article

Lights Out Solid Cube (P447). Consider the 3x3x3
cube. In Lights Out Solid Cube, each of the 27 unit
cubes has exactly one of two states: light on or light
off. The light status can be changed by activating
any choice of unit cube. When a particular unit cube
is activated, its light status toggles as does any other
unit cube that shares a face with the activated cube.

1) If all 27 unit cubes initially have their lights
on, what is the maximal number of unit
cubes that can be turned off using unlimited moves?
2) What is the minimal number of moves needed to
achieve the light state from part 1?
4) Determine the answers to analogous
questions for the n x n x n cube.
